    <p class="mb-4">TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build user interfaces declaratively. It's similar to Bootstrap, Foundation, and Bulma, but it's different in that it doesn't come with any pre-built components. Instead, it provides you with a set of utility classes that you can use to build your own components.</p>
